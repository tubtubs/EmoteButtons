# EmoteButtons
Based on an addon by QuippeR (originally released ~2006)
Adds an expanding menu system that grants access to emotes, slash commands and macros. Supports profiles, and export and importing of profiles. Shift click a button, or type /eb for more options.

# Installation:
1. Click the Code button to the upper right hand corner and select download or click [here](https://github.com/tubtubs/EmoteButtons/archive/refs/heads/master.zip).
2. Unzip the download into your Interface/Addons folder in your WoW directory. Eg: *C:\Games\WoW\Interface\Addons*
3. Rename the folder from *EmoteButtons-master* to *EmoteButtons*
4. Restart WoW and enable the addon from the character selection screen. Ensure your addon memory cap is set to 0 (no limit) as well.

You can also use the [GitAddonsManager](https://gitlab.com/woblight/GitAddonsManager) to install this addon.

-If there are any further issues with installation, ensure that *VanillaStoryline.toc* is in the root folder. There should be no subdirectories. Eg: *C:\Games\WoW\Interface\Addons\EmoteButtons\EmoteButtons.toc*
